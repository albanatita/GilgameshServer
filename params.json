The server, based on the JupyterHub architecture, offers the access to Jupyter notebooks for a small team. The notebooks can be shared and a central bibliography gives simple access to latex-like citations in each notebook.\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-pre-alpha version oriented, for the moment, for internal use and for understanding the operation of JupyterHub.  It is working on Windows and can support a team of 6-7 users.\r\n",
